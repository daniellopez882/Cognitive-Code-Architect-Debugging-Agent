> *"TitanAI isn't just a linter—it's a high-performance cognitive architect that reasons about your logic, predicts architectural failures, and autonomously crafts surgical code repairs."*

**TitanAI** is a premium autonomous system designed for deep code auditing. Built on a **LangGraph-based cyclic architecture**, it employs **11 specialized reasoning nodes** to mirror the mental clarity of a principal staff engineer.

## 📌 The "Code Rot" Challenge

Enterprise codebases fail not just due to syntax errors, but because of:
1.  **Invisible Logic Breaches**: Code that runs but produces incorrect outcomes.
2.  **Architectural Drift**: Intentional patterns being ignored over time.
3.  **Security Gaps**: Hardcoded secrets or unsafe parsing that static linters miss.
4.  **Review Fatigue**: Human reviewers missing subtle concurrency or performance issues.

**CodeGuardian solves this** by treating code review as an agentic workflow. It doesn't just "check" code; it **reasons** about it across multiple specialized dimensions.

## ✨ Titan-Level Intelligence
 
 ### ⚡ Agentic Self-Correction (Auto-Fix)
Powered by the `generate_fixes` node, TitanAI doesn't just point out problems—it engineers solutions. 
 - **Safe-Only Refactoring**: Automatically addresses medium-to-high severity issues that have high confidence scores.
 - **Human-in-the-loop (HITL)**: Advanced configuration allows for mandatory developer approval before applying security or architectural fixes.
 
 ### 🛡️ 11-Phase Intelligence Pipeline
TitanAI executes a strictly orchestrated cognitive workflow defined in `graph.py`:
 - **Static Analysis**: Pylint/Flake8/ESLint integration.
 - **Pattern Matching**: Detects anti-patterns and suboptimal "code smells".
 - **Security Audit**: Scans for CWE Top 25, insecure dependencies, and secret leakage.
 - **Performance Profiling**: Identifies N+1 queries, memory bottlenecks, and complexity spikes.
 - **Testing Assessment**: Audits test coverage and identifies "missing edge-case" scenarios.
 - **Logic Verification**: Deep reasoning about function intent vs. implementation.
 
 ### ⚙️ Declarative Configuration (`.titanai.yml`)
 Manage your entire audit policy with a production-grade YAML spec:
 - Define excluded/included directory patterns.
 - Set complexity thresholds (Cyclomatic/Cognitive).
 - Configure language-specific linter rules.
 - Enable/Disable specific agent nodes based on performance needs.

## 📊 Enterprise Reporting Suite

CodeGuardian generates high-fidelity reports tailored for different stakeholders:
- **Markdown Summary**: Optimized for GitHub Action logs and PR comments.
- **JSON Structured Data**: For integration into existing CI/CD dashboards (Datadog/ELK).
- **GitHub Issues Integration**: Automatically creates and labels issues for discovered vulnerabilities.

### Sample Finding Snippet:
```markdown
### 🕵️ Finding: SEC-024 (Insecure SQL Handling)
- **Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Location**: `src/db/manager.py:84`
- **Reasoning**: User-controlled string 'query_tag' is directly interpolated into a raw SQL string, bypassing ORM protections.
- **Recommendation**: Use a parameterized query or the helper method `safe_execute()`.
- **Auto-Fix Generated**: ✅ YES (See PR Preview)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ismail-2001/Code-Review-and-Debugging-Agent.git
cd Code-Review-and-Debugging-Agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# OR
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Configure your standards in `.codeguardian.yml`.

### 3. Run Your First Review
```bash
# Analyze a local project
python main.py --path /path/to/your/project --severity high

# Analyze a specific branch
python main.py --path /path/to/repo --branch feature/login-security
```

## 🔭 The Lab Roadmap

### ✅ Completed
- [x] **LangGraph Orchestrator**: Multi-node state machine for reasoning.
- [x] **Stateful Memory**: Preserves context across analysis phases.
- [x] **Configuration Layer**: Full YAML-based control.

### 🔨 Phase 2: Cognitive Depth (Next)
- [ ] **Cross-File Dependency Mapping**: Detecting issues that span multiple modules.
- [ ] **RAG-Powered Policies**: Auditing code against custom enterprise Wiki/Documentation.
- [ ] **Interactive Debugger**: A CLI loop to chat with the agent about specific files.
